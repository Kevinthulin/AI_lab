# Movie recommender and Cardiovascular disease predicter

Welcome to the AI_lab! In this lab, we explore the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence and its applications.

One of the exciting projects i am working on is a movie recommender system. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, analyze user preferences and recommend movies that are likely to be enjoyed. Whether you're a fan of action, romance, or comedy, our movie recommender will help you discover new films that match your taste.

Another project we are focusing on is disease prediction for Cardiovascular disease. By leveraging AI techniques, aim to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of Carivalur disease. This will enable early intervention and improve the chances of successful treatment.
